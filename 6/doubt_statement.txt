Ques : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subarray-with-given-sum/0

/*MY DOUBT : 
Your program took more time than expected.Time Limit Exceeded
Expected Time Limit < 0sec
Hint : Please optimize your code and submit again.

Can u help me resolving this and point out my mistakes?
Sum of a subarray was given Along with no of test cases and size of array
And we had to tell the positions where they lied
Like 12378 and sum is 12
So output would be 2 4 i.e from 2nd to 4th term
My code was fine but time complexity u know .Pls help by correcting my code.

// Code to debug and correct :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	//code
	int n,s,t;
	cin>>t;
	
	 while(t>0)
	{
	    cin>>s>>n;
	    int ar[1000];int sum=0;int i;int start=0;
	    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	    {
	        cin>>ar[i];
	    }
	    
	    
	    for(i=start;i<n;i++)
	    {   
	        
	        while(sum<s)
	        sum=sum+ar[i];
	        if(sum>s)
	        {
	            sum=sum-ar[start];
	            start++;
	            sum=sum+ar[i];
	        }
	        if(sum==s)
	        {
	            cout<<start+1<<""<<i+1<<endl;
	        }
	        
	        
	    }
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
