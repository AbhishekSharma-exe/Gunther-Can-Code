## Hello , I am Gunther .I work at Central Perk and its 1998.For reasons I cant tell , I want to be more than a person called Ross .He is a palientologist .You know what , he called me a "stupid bartender" .I hate the sight of that palientologist .And have decided that I will beat him and win the heart of someone special by becoming something that Ross can never become , a software developer .

## Yes , it seems lame I know .But I have started my journey to become a real smart person .By the way , would it be wrong to ask to help me with some doubts from C++ .I really really need help
