/*Hello . This is my solution to the question given in hackerrank as follows:

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-basic-data-types/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen

Print int 3,
followed by long 12345678912345,
followed by char a,
followed by float 334.230,
followed by double 14049.304930000.

Note:
hackerrank itself gives input to the code. therefore here I have initialsed values here by myself.

my queries:
(i)initially I used cin and cout(in hackerrank). It only worked in 1(didnt get all decimal places) out of 3 cases.
(ii)Since the post had suggested to use printf and scanf, I tried my code in my pc with dev c++ as follows:
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cstdio>
    using namespace std;

    int main() 
    {
        int a;
        long b;
        char c;
        float d;
        double e;
        scanf("%d%ld%c%f%lf",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e);
        printf("%d\n%ld\n%c\n%f\n%lf\n",a,b,c,d,e);
        return 0;
    }

    There was no compilation error but when it was running and when I pressed enter after entering char value,
    it stopped taking any more values and displayed only the values which it took.
    
    I also tried to take in the char value at last after taking in all values, but it didnt take it. I also tried to
    enter all the values in the same line without hitting enter
    
    Input: 3 12345678912345 334.230 14049.304930000 a
    
    but the output was like this:
    3
    2135140125

    0.000000
    0.000000

Thank you for reading my doubts with patience. I hope I understand it. :)
